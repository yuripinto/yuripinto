### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yuri, I was born in 1994 and I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I have been working as a software developer for just over a decade. I'm fluent in full-stack development, and software architecture and love learning new ways to apply technology to solve real-world problems.

In recent years I have been focused on personal projects, most of them exploring technologies such as Python and Ruby.
