### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yuri Pinto. I was born in 1994 and I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

I've been working as a software developer for around a decade. I'm fluent in full stack development, software architecture and love to learn new ways of applying technology to solve real problems.

I'm interested in mobile dev, software architecture, SRE, SEO, audio engineering, etc. Currently studying audio engineering and related technologies.
